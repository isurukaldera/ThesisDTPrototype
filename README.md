*Developed as part of Master's Thesis Research at LUT University*

---

## 📚 Research Context

This repository contains the complete functional prototype developed for my Master's Thesis:

**"A Digital Twin System for Retail Inventory & Sales Management: From conceptual architecture to a functional AI-enhanced prototype"**

*Lappeenranta–Lahti University of Technology (LUT)*  
*Master's Programme in Digital Systems and Service Development*  
*Author: Isuru Hollupathirage | Supervisor: Associate Professor Annika Wolff*

### 🔍 Research Problem
This prototype addresses key gaps identified in retail inventory management:
- Lack of real-time shelf visibility in physical stores
- Privacy concerns in customer tracking systems  
- Limited integration between physical operations and digital analytics
- Inefficient demand forecasting leading to stockouts/overstocking

### 🎯 Research Objectives Achieved
1. ✅ **Comparative Analysis** of existing retail inventory systems
2. ✅ **Conceptual Architecture** design integrating RFID and POS data
3. ✅ **Functional Prototype** with 3D visualization and AI forecasting
4. ✅ **Simulated AI Models** for demand prediction and inventory alerts

## 🏗️ Prototype Overview

This prototype demonstrates a **privacy-conscious Digital Twin** that bridges physical retail operations with digital intelligence through:

### Core Components
- **3D Virtual Environment** (Unity): Real-time store and warehouse visualization
- **AI Forecasting Engine**: Ensemble model (SMA + WMA + Linear Regression)
- **Heatmap Analytics**: Sales performance visualization
- **Inventory Management**: Automated alerts and restocking logic
- **Simulated Database**: 350+ products across 10 categories

### Key Research Contributions
- GDPR-compliant approach focusing on product movement rather than customer tracking
- Integration of RFID-inspired logic with simulated POS data
- Proof-of-concept for spatial anchoring and real-time product visualization
- Validation of ensemble forecasting models in retail context

## 🧪 Research Methodology

### Development Approach
1. **Literature Review**: Comparative analysis of inventory systems (PRISMA protocol)
2. **Conceptual Design**: Multi-layer architecture with security considerations  
3. **Prototype Development**: Agile implementation with simulated data
4. **Validation**: Functional testing of all integrated components

### Technical Implementation
| Research Component | Implementation |
|-------------------|----------------|
| **Virtual Representation** | Unity 3D environment with spatial mapping |
| **Data Integration** | SQLite database with realistic retail schema |
| **AI Forecasting** | Python/FastAPI with ensemble models |
| **Real-time Updates** | REST API communication between systems |
