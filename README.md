 **Thesis Prototype: Retail Digital Twin**

A Functional Digital Twin Prototype for Retail Inventory Management
*Developed as part of Master's Thesis Research at LUT University*


 **Research Context**

This repository contains the complete functional prototype developed for my Master's Thesis:

**A Digital Twin System for Retail Inventory & Sales Management: From conceptual architecture to a functional AI-enhanced prototype**

*Lappeenranta–Lahti University of Technology (LUT)*  
*Master's Programme in Digital Systems and Service Development*  
*Author: Isuru Hollupathirage | Supervisor: Associate Professor Annika Wolff*

**Prototype Overview**

This prototype demonstrates a privacy-conscious Digital Twin that bridges physical retail operations with digital intelligence through:

 Core Components
- 3D Virtual Environment (Unity): Real-time store and warehouse visualization
- AI Forecasting Engine: Ensemble model (SMA + WMA + Linear Regression)
- Heatmap Analytics: Sales performance visualization
- Inventory Management: Automated alerts and restocking logic
- Simulated Database: 350+ products across 10 categories



 Technical Implementation
| Research Component | Implementation |
|-------------------|----------------|
| Virtual Representation | Unity 3D environment with spatial mapping |
| Data Integration | SQLite database with realistic retail schema |
| AI Forecasting | Python/FastAPI with ensemble models |
| Real-time Updates | REST API communication between systems |





Prerequisites
- Unity 2022.3.62f1
